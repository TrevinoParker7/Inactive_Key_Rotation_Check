## 🧠 The Premise

One of the most common vulnerabilities in the cloud?  
**Stale AWS IAM keys**.  
They’re lurking in the shadows, waiting to be exploited, causing compliance nightmares, and giving auditors premature heart attacks.

This lab is your **portfolio-ready escape hatch**.  
You’ll automate detection of **stale keys**, classify their risk, and produce **audit-ready remediation reports**.

## 💾 Why It Matters

Auditors, compliance teams, and hiring managers don’t care about fancy dashboards.  
They care about one thing:

> “Can you show me **evidence** that keys are rotated and secure?”

After this lab, was able to give confidently answer: ✅ **Yes.**  
No screenshots. No hand-holding. Just clean, automated evidence mapped to **SOC 2** and **NIST** controls.

## ⚙️ How This Lab Frees You From the Spreadsheet Matrix

### 🧱 For Your Portfolio
Showcase **key lifecycle management in action**.  
You’ll have JSON and CSV reports displaying:

- Compliance status  
- Risk classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Compliant)  
- Remediation recommendations  

You’re not just “knowing compliance” — you’re **engineering it**.

### 🧑‍💼 For Interviews
Employers want more than buzzwords.  
You’ll walk through how you:

- Queried **IAM for all users and their keys**  
- Classified **risks intelligently**  
- Produced **actionable reports** instead of a thousand manual spreadsheets  

Lean back. Watch their jaws drop.

### 💼 For LinkedIn
Post like a GRC Neo:

> “Just finished a lab automating inactive key rotation checks in AWS.  
> Instead of spreadsheets, I now have JSON and CSV evidence with risk classifications and remediation steps.  
> This is how we take GRC from manual review to engineering.”

Watch the likes rain like green Matrix code.
